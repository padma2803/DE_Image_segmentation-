# DE_Image_segmentation-
#Overview:

Image segmentation plays a crucial role in the pre-processing phase of image analysis. The objective is to partition an image into meaningful components or regions of interest, where each pixel is assigned a label based on shared visual characteristics. This technique enables various applications such as object recognition, motion analysis, image compression, and more.

This project focuses on developing techniques for image segmentation, addressing two specific challenges:

Texture Object Segmentation:

The first part of the work involves segmenting single or multiple objects from an image, considering the presence of foreground and background textures. Active contour models are employed, incorporating texture features to enhance the segmentation process.

Complex Object Segmentation in Color Images: 

The second part of the project tackles the complex task of segmenting objects with holes and regions that closely resemble the background's color distribution. This technique aims to efficiently and accurately segment such challenging objects.

#Motivation:

The main goal of image segmentation is to simplify the representation of an image, making it easier to understand by reducing complex visual information into meaningful segments. This project aims to advance image segmentation techniques to improve the accuracy and efficiency of segmenting objects in various scenarios.

#Key Features:

1.Texture object segmentation using active contour models.
2.Efficient segmentation of objects with holes and challenging color distributions.
3.Enhances image preprocessing for various downstream applications.

#Getting Started:

To use the segmentation techniques developed in this project, follow these steps:

1.Clone the repository to your local machine:
